#### :balloon: Task Description:
You are an analyst in the Olist company in the Payments & Monetisation department, which is responsible for understanding your clients' (merchants who are on Olist platform) data from a payments perspective. As it is quite a big company, it has this separate department which basically improves SaaS (Software as a Service) products with help from you. Your analysis plays an important role in what kind of product changes are implemented and whether the company manages to optimize their efforts in growing their revenue. Your main stakeholder is the product manager in the Payments & Monetisation team, but occasionally, you get requests from other departments, since you are a company expert on transactional payments data.
He does not give you concrete questions to be answered, just asks you to use any data in the company databases and come up with a useful analysis on your own.

#### :balloon: Result:
A dashboard consisting of 4 parts is created: an overview page, product categories monetization, regions and delivery information, review score analysis.
These dashboards are there to help to identify monetization improvements areas - to notice potential in specific areas.
