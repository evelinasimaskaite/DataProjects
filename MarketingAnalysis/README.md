#### :balloon: Task Description:
You have a follow up task from your marketing manager to identify overall trends of all marketing campaigns on your ecommerce site. She is particularly interested in finding out if users tend to spend more time on your website on certain weekdays and how that behavior differs across campaigns.

#### :balloon: Result:
All website events are sessionized. Average session duration per marketing campaign is measured, as well as comparison with other traffic sources is done and more engagement metrics explored. (Note. Original dataset was slightly adjusted and campaign interpretation changed in some cases.)
